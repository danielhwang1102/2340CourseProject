- i can see my profile as a job seeker, but i am not sure if i can edit my profile as a job seeker or as a recruiter (Daniel will do this)
- /accounts/logout/ has terrible ui (Maryam will do this)
- since email is not required, if you sign up without filling out email, you can never log back in; make email a mandatory field
- skills doesn’t really work?
- complete profile doesn’t redirect to next page
- why is admin panel a button in home page for recruiters? pls remove it's weird
- location type/compensation/visa/applicaiton deadline not in job post
- /admin broken? admin account not working for some reason
- can’t filter job listings or search listings
